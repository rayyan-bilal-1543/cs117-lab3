What did you notice about registers and instructions?
We noticed that Assembly language uses things called registers like AL, BL, AX. We put numbers in them, and then give step-by-step instructions and every little action has to be written, and even printing something takes many lines.
How is coding in Assembly different from Python?
Coding in Assembly feels very low level. It is like talking directly to the computer in its own language and it is hard because we must tell the computer every single step.
Why is Python easier/faster for building the same project?
Python is easier and faster because we can just write simple commands like print() or x = a + b.
Which features of Python help abstraction (variables, functions, loops)?
Python has variables that let us store numbers or text , so we can focus on solving the problem not on controlling the machine step by step.
